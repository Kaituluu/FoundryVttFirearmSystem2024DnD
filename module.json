  "description": "A modular firearm framework for D&D 5e on Foundry VTT v13. FirearmSystem2024 introduces a clean, extensible data model for firearms—including misfire, capacity, and item-local state—designed to integrate seamlessly with existing weapon items. Built as a foundation-first system: no hacks, no assumptions, and no forced automation. Everything is gated behind explicit firearm flags, allowing future UI, automation, and rule expansions to be layered safely and intentionally."
